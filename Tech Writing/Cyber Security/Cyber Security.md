# Cyber Security
## 1. Security Principles 
Cybersecurity principles are fundamental to protecting information and systems against digital attacks. Here is a list of each principle and how they contribute to a highly effective security posture:

- **Confidentiality**: This principle ensures that information is only accessed by authorized individuals. It is protected through solutions such as encryption and access control.

- **Integrity**: This principle ensures that information is not altered by unauthorized individuals, keeping it accurate and complete. This is maintained through hashes, digital signatures, and regular audits.

- **Availability**: Refers to the guarantee that authorized users have continuous access to information and resources. This is achieved with system redundancy, regular backups, and disaster recovery plans.

- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of users before granting access to systems. Common methods include passwords, security tokens, and biometrics.

- **Non-Repudiation**: Prevents a party from denying the authorship or receipt of a transaction. This is often implemented using digital signatures and audit logs.
This principle is essential to ensuring the integrity of electronic transactions and creating a trusted digital environment.

- **Authorization**: Defines what a user can and cannot do within a system after being authenticated. This includes read, write, and execute permissions.

- **Auditing**: Involves monitoring and recording user activity to detect and investigate suspicious or unauthorized activity.

- **Awareness and Training**: Ensures that all users are aware of security threats and know how to act safely.

- **Incident Response**: Establishes procedures to respond quickly to security breaches, minimizing damage and restoring normal operations.

- **Disaster Recovery**: Prepares plans for the rapid recovery of systems and data after a security incident.

- **Business Continuity**: Ensures that essential business operations can continue during and after a security incident.

- **Risk Management**: Identifies, assesses, and prioritizes risks, applying resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability and/or impact of unwanted events.

- **Encryption**: Uses mathematical algorithms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data during transmission and storage.

- **Physical Security**: Protects hardware, software, and infrastructure from physical attacks and natural disasters.

These principles are the backbone of an effective cybersecurity strategy and should be taken seriously by organizations and individuals to protect against growing digital threats. It is crucial that readers understand the importance of implementing these practices to maintain the security of their information and systems.

## 2. Vulnerabilities
Security flaws in web applications are a major concern for developers and system administrators. Here are some of the most common:
