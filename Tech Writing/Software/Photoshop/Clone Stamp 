## Introduction  
The **Clone Stamp Tool** in Adobe Photoshop allows you to copy pixels from one area of an image and paint them onto another area. It is commonly used to:  
- Remove unwanted objects (e.g., wires, blemishes).  
- Repair damaged photos (e.g., scratches, stains).  
- Duplicate elements (e.g., trees, clouds).  

**Target Audience**:  
- Adults with basic computer skills and minimal Photoshop experience.

### 3. Duplicating Elements
