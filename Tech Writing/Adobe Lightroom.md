# Saving your file 

 **JPEG/JPG:** JPEG is a widely used format for photographs and web graphics. It offers a good balance between file size and image quality. JPEGs use lossy compression, meaning some image data is discarded, which can result in a loss of quality if the file is repeatedly edited and saved. 

**To save as JPEG/JPG:** 

- Go to File > Save As. 
- Choose JPEG from the Format dropdown menu.
- Adjust the Quality slider to control the file size and image compression level. 
- Click Save. 

**PNG:** PNG is a popular format for web graphics and images that require transparency. It supports lossless compression, meaning image quality is preserved even with repeated edits and saves. PNGs tend to have larger file sizes compared to JPEGs. 

**To save as PNG:** 

- Go to File > Save As. 
- Choose PNG from the Format dropdown menu. 
- Click Save. 

**GIF:** GIF is mostly used for simple graphics, animations, and web icons. It supports transparency and animation. However, GIF has limited color reproduction (256 colors), making it unsuitable for complex images or photographs.  

**To save as GIF:**
- Go to File > Save As. 
- Choose GIF from the Format dropdown menu. 
- Click Save. 

**TIFF:** TIFF is a highly versatile format suitable for professional print work and high-quality images. It supports lossless compression, multiple layers, transparency, and high-bit depths. TIFF files tend to be large in size. 

 **To save as TIFF:** 
- Go to File > Save As. 
- Choose TIFF from the Format dropdown menu. 
- Click Save. 

**PSD:** PSD is Photoshop's native file format, which preserves all layers, adjustments, and editable elements. PSD files are ideal for retaining full editing capabilities and working on projects that need ongoing modifications. 

**To save as PSD:** 
- Go to File > Save As. 
- Choose PSD from the Format dropdown menu. 
- Click Save.
